<H1>JavaCC [tm]: Getting Started</H1>

JavaCC [tm] is packaged for download as a self extracting .class file.
The file you download may be called <code>JavaCC3_0.class</code>.  To install
JavaCC, simply go (cd) to the directory containing this file and
type: <p>

<code>java JavaCC3_0</code> <p>

Make sure that your CLASSPATH environment variable is not set or is set to
be the directory containing this file.  This launches the installer GUI that
takes you through a set of screens and then installs JavaCC.  You can
also do a command line installation by typing: <p>

<code>java JavaCC3_0 -c</code> <p>

Once you have completed installation, add the <code>bin</code> directory
within the JavaCC installation to your path.  The <code>javacc</code>,
<code>jjtree</code>, and <code>jjdoc</code> invocation scripts/executables
reside in this directory. <p>

You can get started quickly by looking at the examples and the associated
README files in the <code>examples</code> directory under the installation
directory.  <a href="docindex.html">Click here</a> to read the JavaCC
